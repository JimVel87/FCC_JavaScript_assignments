# FCC_JavaScript_assignments

This is the code I wrote in order to pass the 5 assignments needed to complete the course "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" offered by FreeCodeCamp.
All solutions have been tested and work as intended with a variety of inputs. They are all implemented in JavaScript ES6.

NOTE: As you are supposed to implement your own solutions, please do not use this code to pass the assignments. Feel free, however, to compare your solutions to mine.
